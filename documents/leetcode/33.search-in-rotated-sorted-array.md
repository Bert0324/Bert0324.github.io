# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

source: <https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/>

## Question

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

## 思路

好像涉及Binary Search的题目都看起来特别的简单，比如4题, 但是对于特定的时间复杂度，又必须要使用。

```js
```

## End

对于查找数组中某个元素的问题，可以优先考虑二分查找。
